__Ecole Polytechnique, Paris (Palaiseau)__ Master of science in applied mathematics.

 - *Relevant courses* : Optimization, Statistical learning theory, Deep learning and Generative models, High dimensional statistics, Stochastic approximation and Reinforcement learning, Bootstrap and resampling methods, Computer vision.

`2018-2021`
__Télécom Paris, Paris (Palaiseau)__  Graduate engineering school, majoring in computer science and applied mathematics. *(GPA 3.9/4)*

__Lycée Albert Camus, Fréjus__ Baccalaureate with highest honours
 

## Experiences

`2021`
__Research Intern__ at Laboratoire Cedric (CNAM). I work on Reinforcement Learning, the main topic of research is to generate and quantify diversified behaviours of agents in a given environnement. The search of such sub-optimal policies is conducted on video games running on the Unity-3D engine.

`2020`
__Co-author__ of the book *Intégrer l'X ou l'école d'ingénieurs de tes rêves avec les Sherpas*, published in June 2020 by Vuibert, a major publishing company in France. The book is a guide for undergraduate students to suceed at the nationwide competitive exams for engineering schools.

## Projects

`2021`
__Competitor__ in the 2021 edition of Hackaton Hi!Paris. Optimization of the energy consumption of a building with solar panels using a smart grid controller. We leveraged reinforcement learning methods (DQN, A2C) as well as heuristics (rule based strategy) to minimize the cost and the environemental impact of our building.

`2021`
__Developer__ of a project on pretraining parameters of a Deep Neural Network using a Restricted Boltzmann Machine. Implementation from scratch in Python of a RBM structure trained with the CD-1 algorithm using Gibbs sampling. The comparative advantage of such pretrain was tested on a classic DNN model using the MNIST dataset.

`2020`
__Maintainer__ of an experiment on predicting outcomes of competitive *Counter-Strike* games, including a theoretical approach (probabilistic and gambling theory), an implementation using different elo-based computed features as well as simulations to validate winning strategies. (*Whole project on my github*).
